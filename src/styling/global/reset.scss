    Note: the `:modal` pseudo-class applies when the modal is in the top layer *and* currently open. That means that it
    stops applying during an exit transition, which will break the styling. The upcoming `:open` pseudo-class doesn't
    resolve this either. Chrome internally has an `:-internal-dialog-in-top-layer` pseudo-class for this, but it's not
    exposed.
    
    We can work around this by applying the modal styling on `dialog` regardless of `:modal`. However, that breaks
    regular (non-modal) styling. It is essentially impossible to generically style dialog elements without knowing
    whether it's going to be used as a modal or not, if we also want exit transitions.
    
    This reset assumes you do *not* apply an exit transition, by default. If you do want an exit transition, you can
    set `aria-model="true"` to opt in. Or, you can manually apply the `position: fixed` (etc.) styling on the base
    `dialog` yourself.
