/* Cascade layer ordering */

/*
Note: this ordering must be emitted before any other CSS rules, because browsers determine the layering order by which
layers are specified first. Take particular care that in Sass, `@import` rules are hoisted, and so any `@import` may
break our layering order [1]. `@import` is deprecated anyway, so we should not use it anywhere.

In production Storybook builds it is hard to guarantee style ordering, so make sure to also inject this at the top
of `preview-head.html`.

    app, // Consumer application styling (*)
    accessibility, // Global accessibility styling that should take precedence over components by default
    storybook; // Storybook styling (e.g. docs pages)
  @layer
    baklava.base, // Global base styling
    baklava.theming, // Themes (e.g. light/dark mode)
    baklava.prose, // Default semantic HTML styling for prose sections
    baklava.components, // Component styling
    baklava.overrides; // Local overrides (e.g. components that need to override other components)
  
  // (*) In the future, we could maybe use caret syntax for this instead, so that consumer applications just use regular
  // unlayered styling and anything that needs higher precedence uses `@layer ^my-layer`.
