/* Cascade layer ordering */

/*
Note: this ordering must be emitted before any other CSS rules, because browsers determine the layering order by which
layers are specified first. Take particular care that in Sass, `@import` rules are hoisted, and so any `@import` may
break our layering order [1]. `@import` in Sass has been deprecated and will be removed in the future.

@layer normalize, reset, baklava, app, accessibility, storybook;
@layer baklava.base, baklava.body-text, baklava.theming, baklava.components;

/*
In production Storybook builds it is hard to guarantee
style ordering, so we also inject this list at the top of `preview-head.html`.
